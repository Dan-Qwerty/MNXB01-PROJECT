idea for analysis:
choose two time periods (say, 1940-1950 and 2005-2015). for each day in a given time period, take the average of the temperature on that day across the time period,
and then plot the resulting two graphs on top of each other for easy comparison - CF


analyse the specified month temperature for every year including:
-- plot the histogram of average temperature
-- find and plot the highest/lowest temperature of that month in each month
-- do some fits, analysis the trend
etc

Long term regression plot with candidate function consisting of the sum of a sinusoidal and linear component.

Make a command line that works similarly to the root command line. Should be able to run commands to produce the plots.
