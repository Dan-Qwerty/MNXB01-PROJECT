# MNXB01-PROJECT
This is the project in the course MNXB01 2021 HT

All codes are based on Aurora. 

There are some steps before inspecting the codes and results.

Please open the file src/rootlogon.C, modify the path of include/ in the command:
gInterpreter->AddIncludePath("-I/home/ql93/git/MNXB01-PROJECT/include");
to your own absolute path of include/ on your computer.

Then load and run ROOT inside the directory src/ 

All of the files will be linked automatically.

We use the following commands to load ROOT on Auror:

module load GCC/5.4.0-2.26
module load OpenMPI/1.10.3
module load ROOT/6.10.02-Python-2.7.12

Team members: Carl-Fredrik Lidgren, Daniel Falkowski, Isak Ellme, Qian Liu
