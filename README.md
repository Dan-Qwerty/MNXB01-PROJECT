# MNXB01-PROJECT
The project of the course MNXB01

Use the makefile to compile the project.
Run the command "module load GCCcore/8.3.0" if you're compiling on aurora.
The standard compiler is too old.

The project will not compile on windows, only on aurora.
To compile on windows remove $(ROOT_LIB) in the makefile.
